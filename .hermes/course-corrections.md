# Course Corrections — Outer Loop -> Inner Loop

The OUTER loop appends prioritized directives here on detecting drift, guardrail violations, quality regressions, or off-task work. The INNER loop reads this FIRST every tick and resolves OPEN corrections as top priority before normal work.

**Protocol:**
- Outer APPENDS corrections as OPEN; never edits build-state.md (avoids write races).
- Inner addresses each OPEN item, then marks it RESOLVED (commit <sha>) and moves it to Resolved. After resolving all OPEN items, **clean up the Open section** by writing `_(none — inner loop in alignment as of last audit)_`.
- Severity: BLOCKER (stop normal work, fix now) / HIGH (this tick) / MEDIUM (within 2 ticks) / LOW (when convenient).
